            Here are some tips to prevent and end cyber bullying: </h5>
        <ul>
    <li><strong>
    Do not respond or retaliate.</strong> Sometimes it is worse than reactions, because that is exactly what the aggressor is looking for. It's a way that you make him think he has power over you and he shouldn't believe it.</li>
            <li><strong>Save the evidence.</strong>
            The only good thing about cyberbullying is that the act is usually captured, stored and shown to someone who can help you. You can save the evidence in case things get worse.</li>
            <li><strong>Tell the abuser to stop.</strong> This is up to you completely. Do not do it if you do not feel totally comfortable with it, because you will have to make it clear that this is not the last time you allow to be treated that way. You may need to practice with someone you trust, such as your parents or your best friend.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek help.</strong> Especially if the situation is really affecting you. You deserve support, so you should find someone who can listen or help you, and work to solve it. It can be a friend, a relative or an adult with whom you have confidence.</li>
            <li><strong>
            Use the available technology.</strong> Most social networks, Apps and services allow you to block contacts. Whatever type of cyberbullying you are suffering, you must block the responsible person and report the problem to the corresponding service or application. Although this does not serve to curb the situation, you can stop the harassment publicly and be less tempted to respond. If you suffer threats that may endanger your physical integrity, you should call the police and consider reporting the case to the school authorities.</li>
        </ul>
